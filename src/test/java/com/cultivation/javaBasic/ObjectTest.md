### should_point_to_the_same_object()
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar with Object references

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the incorrect expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Because both variables are references to the same Object instance

4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No questions so far.



### should_point_to_different_object()
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar with Object references

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the incorrect expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Although the attributes are the same, they are different instances of the object

4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No questions so far.



### should_initialized_to_default_value()
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar with the default values for some variables

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the empty expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Because it is the expected default values

4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No questions so far.



### should_pass_by_value()
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar with passing by value

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the empty expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Because it is the expected result when passing by value

4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No questions so far.



### should_pass_by_value_continued()
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar with passing by value

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the empty expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Because it references to the same new Object instance

4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No questions so far.



### should_modify_internal_state()
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar with modifying object state

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the incorrect expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Because it references to the same object and modifying an attribute will modify the attribute of the object instance

4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No questions so far.



### should_choose_method_at_compile_time()
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar with choosing which method when methods are overloaded

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the incorrect expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Because it will be calling the method that matches the parameter given

4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No questions so far.



### should_choose_the_most_specific_overload()
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar with choosing which method when methods are overloaded

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the incorrect expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Because it will be calling the method that matches the parameter given. In this case, a string and an int

4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No questions so far.



### should_calling_another_constructor()
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar that constructors can call other constructors

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the incorrect expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Because the constructor called, called another constructor that accepts a String parameter and sets it to the name

4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No questions so far.



### should_get_initialization_ordering()
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar that constructors can call other constructors

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the incorrect expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Because of the current implementation of the called constructors

4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No questions so far.



### should_get_message_of_var_length_parameters()
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar with passing parameters of different length

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the incorrect expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* Because of the current implementation for varargs

4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No questions so far.
