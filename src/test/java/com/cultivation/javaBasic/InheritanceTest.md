1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar with derivation of inheritance

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the incorrect expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?

1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the test is to be familiar with derivation of inheritance

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the incorrect expected result

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
